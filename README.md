# Melenoma Detection Assignment
> Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

#### Objective
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.

## Approach

Following is the step-by-step approach followed to solve the given problem statement:
1. Data Understanding
1. Building Simple Model (Model I)
1. Building Model with Augment layer (Model II)
1. Using Augmentor (for increase dataset)
1. Building Model with Augmentor dataset (Model III)

## Conclusions

## Technologies Used
- Python (ver 3.12.7)
- NumPy (ver 1.26.4)
- Pandas (ver 2.2.2)
- MatplotLib (ver 3.9.2)
- Tensorflow (ver 2.18.0)
- Keras (ver 3.8.0)
- Augmentor (ver 0.2.12)
